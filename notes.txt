  repeating data

    - yearly cost is too expensive
    - statistics dept. has a server, but now Dan can't figure out
      how to push updates to that server
    - should live at servers at carleton, or should he push for funding?
    - could he push to GitHub, and have it automatically uploaded
      to the server?
